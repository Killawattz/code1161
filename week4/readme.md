TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Week 4 

This week was definitely an incredible step up in difficulty, I personally had a large difficulty in attempting to understand the 
exercises this week. I spent hours on the internet trying to figure out what was happening within the the functions and what methods
to use to overcome the exercise problems present. I had to use a number of new functions and methods that I was unfamiliar with, but
had previously seen within the hangman exercise, which I now understand. This include functions, like searching and finding values within
json directory, retrieving data from an online server using a URL and also creating and writing data to a new file. It did take me a long
time, I noticed working with and recieving help from fellow class mates is extremely helpful, along with finiding answers on piazza. 
Although in the end, I was able to write script for each function, it's just that a lot of them don't exactly work as intended. 
But overall this week was definitely a large incemental from prior weeks, which I guess is understandable as we move further 
throughout the course.

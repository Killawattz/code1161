TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

This week, was another complete jump up in terms of difficulty, but still built on those key aspects from the weeks prior, overall it was a challenging week, and most of the exercises were completed with success except for the final 2 tasks on exercise 3 which weren't producing the correct outcomes intended, and I wasn't able to get them to work before the submission date, so they remain incomplete.

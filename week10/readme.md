TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Last week we worked on the machine learning task that required pair based teamwork, and I decided to pair with Zack Hefferman, and this week we were asked to present our progress to the tutors marking our work. Zack and I were only able to get the main programn running, where it was at a state in which it would constantly hail a taxi. Unfortunately we were not able to achieve the remaining 30% which was the other part requiring us to work out the code to stop this hail with hand movement. This week wtihin the lecture we were briefed with the final assessment for this course which basically consists of choosing a particular data set, generating a question regarding that particular data set, then finding the data within that data set and then writing some code to display the answer to that question with the discovered data. Basically within this lesson we looked at various data sets to get an idea and hopefully have picked a data set and a question, with appropriate knowledge into that set of data. I currently have a few data sets in mind and some potential questions, and its just a matter of narrowing it down, and I will aslo need to ask some questions within week 10's tutorial to clear up my understanding of the task itself.

TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

This week was defintely a challenge to say the least, using kaggle and understanding how to plot graphs and what not was definitely a hard task for me honestly, as I spent countless hours on various websites like stack overflow and other kernals working out how to do this my way. I ended up with roguhly 4 bar graphs and many failed attempts to create a pie graph and other graphs, that were just simply not working. I can generate an answer from the data I have displayed within my visual depiction, but it just doesn't seem enough for me anyway. I honestly left this assessment too late, as I set it aside for the onslaught of surrounding course asignments and external isssues suppressing my motivation to even begin this. I know for next time to start things like this earlier, as I would of produced something much more capable, of visualising my answers in more variety and greater depth.

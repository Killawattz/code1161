TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Week 5 

Again I found this week extremely difficult, more so than any other week, and this is expected, I am finding this course qutie difficult
overall, its no walk in the park. I found difficulty in a lot of areas, in terms of finding the math functions and what not, I did learn the 
concept of parameters properly I believe and I feel I can understand the function and be able to comment on already written code. Overall I found 
exercise 1 confusing, but I got a grasp of the main concept, it was trying to achieve I believe. In terms of exercise 2, I was quite unsuccessful
in working out the recursion, overall it was unsuccessful, I think I require more help wtih this weeks.

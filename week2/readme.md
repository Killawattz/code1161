TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

#This week was a significant jump from the previous week, we literally dived into the basics of this language and it was very overhwelming and difficult to keep up and 
#understand everything. I had a lot of difficulties and relied on the aid of tutors but mostly fellow students to explain concepts only the week later as my class wasn't able to broadcast the tutorial live streams, but I did complete the tasks through the aid of my peers within class. It is quite diffuclt at this stage.
